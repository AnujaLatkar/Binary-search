In this code we can search our Element by using Binary search 

  # Binary Search: 
  It is used for a sorted array. It mainly compares the array's middle element
first and if the middle element is same as input, then it returns. Otherwise it searches in either
left half or right half based on comparison result (Whether the mid element is smaller or greater)
